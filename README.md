## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring.

The reason for this project is to evaluate the price of the stocks from each single week. The hypothesis I believed was that if it would stay consistant throught out the weeks. some of the problems I faced was the fact that there would be days where I would have to get right of empty strings for certain days.
